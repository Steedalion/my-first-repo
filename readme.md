### Intro

I consider myself a developer of ideas of sort. Recently these projects have been in physical training, computer systems, personal development, diet and changes. 

## Current goal

My current goal is to become top notch researcher. I plan to achieve this by:
- Completing my *PhD* at a well renowned university
- Conducting high quality research, manifested in *2 research articles* and a *thesis*.



And as **imagination** bodies forth,
The forms of things *unknown*, the poetâ€™s pen,
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing,
A local *habitation* and a **name**.
